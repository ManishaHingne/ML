Avengers: Endgame co-director Joe Russo has released the Hindi anthem for Marvel movies. The song is sung and composed by AR Rahman, who was also present at its launch in Mumbai at a special event on Monday. The colourful music video shows Rahman singing on a stage with a large crowd of youngsters around him. It is peppered with scenes from the previous few MCU movies and the trailer footage from the upcoming Avengers: Endgame. Watch it here:“I know the universal thing about good and evil. So when they briefed me about the story, I wanted to create something that was firm and at the centre of this film,” Rahman said at the event. He also said that he hopes Joe likes the song. Joe said he ‘loved it’.Also read: Avengers: Endgame director Joe Russo confirms he is ‘talking to Priyanka Chopra’ about future project“Being surrounded by Marvel fans in my own family, there was too much pressure to come with something really satisfying and apt for Avengers: Endgame.
